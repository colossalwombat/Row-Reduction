# Row-Reduction

A simple script to create infinite row reduction problems. 

First it comes up with values for the each variable in the augmented matrix,
then it mutates the matrix with random elementary row operations. It uses the sympy RREF to solve the matrix 
once a solution is requested. 

##Dependencies

`numpy, sympy'


##Installation (for those new to Python)
1. Install Python 3 from python.org
2. Install the dependencies
'pip3 install numpy sympy'
3. Download and the run the script (clone the repository or just use the zip download)
Run from the same folder as the "Row Reduction.py"
`python3 "Row Reduction.py"`

Happy solving!
